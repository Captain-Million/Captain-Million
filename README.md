## Development

### Dependencies
<a href="https://david-dm.org/wms-proj/wms-proj"><img src="https://david-dm.org/wms-proj/wms-proj.svg" alt="Dependency Status"></a> â€” stats for `master`.

We should update them one by one. There is **David** cli tool for that. We can use it **without adding** to a project.

- `npm i -g david` installs globally

- `david` in project directory shows a report (for current branch)
